## Hi, I'm Temmi! 🙋🏽

I'm 26 and work as a frontend developer in Dresden, Germany 🇩🇪. When I'm not busy coding or designing websites, I'm usually diving into cool tech stuff. I love playing around with TypeScript, JavaScript, and HTML+CSS to make things look awesome online. 🧑🏽‍💻

But when I'm not glued to my screen, I've got a bunch of other hobbies. I'm into gardening 🌱, cruising around on my longboard 🛹, and chatting about politics 🗳️. I also enjoy hiking 🗻, especially when I need a break from all the tech stuff. Recently, I've been getting into worldbuilding 📔, which is like creating cool imaginary worlds. It's a mix of storytelling and tech that lets me unleash my creativity.

As a frontend developer, I like taking on challenges. I use tools like React and Redux to make websites look slick and work smoothly. I'm also into project management tools like Jira and Notion to keep things organized. ✅

So yeah, I'm just a tech geek who loves to tinker with code and explore new ideas. Whether I'm coding or out in nature, I'm always up for an adventure! 🚀
